1 = original first player
2 = original second player
etc
x = skiped player
# = comments
3	4	1	2	3	4	1	2
		skip	x				
				# the x here doesnt matter because when you reverse you're reverseing from the original player not from after the skiped player
		reverse
3	2	1	4 	3	2	1	4 
			reverse
			skip
1	2	3	4	1	2	3	4
				x	next

# i think this is how reverse skip works
